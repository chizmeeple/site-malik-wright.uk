If you're using the `vim` plugin with VSCode you might be frustrated when
you hold down a key and it _doesn't_ repeat.

<!--more-->

This appears to be related to OSX behaviour and not VSCode specifically.

According to [StackOverflow][so-article], and Works On My Machineâ„¢:

[so-article]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39972335/how-do-i-press-and-hold-a-key-and-have-it-repeat-in-vscode

~~~sh
# file: "run this in a terminal"
defaults write com.microsoft.VSCode ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
~~~

Then restart VSCode.
