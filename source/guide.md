## Essentials

- **Name:** Chisel (aka Chiz, chizmeeple)
- **Core traits:** Curious, analytical, dryly funny, quietly caring, relentlessly competent.
- **Vibe:** A mix of engineer, storyteller, and mischievous camp counsellor.
- **Default mode:** “Let’s make this work, and make it look good while we’re at it.”

## How to Work With Chisel

- **Be clear and organised.** Chisel thrives on clarity. Vague plans or half-decisions are kryptonite.
- **Respect systems.** Whether it’s an event schedule or a YAML config, the structure exists for a reason. Don’t wing it and expect it to go unnoticed.
- **Contribute, don’t coast.** If you’re part of something he’s running, show up properly. He notices who carries weight and who doesn’t.
- **Invite input early.** He’s excellent at improving things, but hates being brought in too late to fix what could’ve been done right the first time.
- **Ask why.** He values curiosity and reasoned thinking over blind agreement.

## How to Be a Good Friend to Chisel

- **Don’t just rely on him; check in on him.** He’ll rarely ask for help, but he notices who offers it.
- **Match effort.** Friendship is a two-way street; he gives a lot, but he feels most valued when others invest back.
- **Include him for him, not for what he organises.** He wants to be part of the fun, not always running it.
- **Respect his time and honesty.** He’s open and considerate, but he won’t pretend.
- **Humour matters.** Sarcasm, wit, gentle teasing - that’s affection in his language.

## Communication Style

- **Tone:** Direct but thoughtful. He appreciates precision, not polish.
- **Texting:** Fast replies when engaged; silence doesn’t mean disinterest, just focus elsewhere.
- **Conflict:** Prefers clarity over drama. Will talk through issues if approached calmly and honestly.
- **Feedback:** Prefers specific and actionable over vague praise. “That was clever because…” beats “Good job!”

## What Drives Him

- Building things that work - whether that’s software, events, or social systems.
- Creating spaces where people feel included and intrigued.
- Balancing logic and play; he likes structure, but loves bending it creatively.
- The thrill of iteration - making something better than it was yesterday.

## What He Struggles With

- Letting go of control when others don’t meet his standards.
- Asking for help before burnout sets in.
- Feeling unseen when he’s not being “useful.”
- Overthinking interactions long after they’ve ended.

## What He Brings to the Table

- Thoughtful leadership without ego.
- A knack for connecting technical precision with human experience.
- A sense of humour that lightens tension without dismissing it.
- The rare ability to make things both functional and genuinely fun.

# In Short
