Although [Google Music is on the way out][music-out] it's active for a few more
months, and if you're like me you might still have [Music
manager][music-manager] running, and downloading "updates" to your collection.

Unless it's just me that Google Music hates you'll discover that you collection
starts to fill up with `MyTrack (1).mp3` and friends.

Being lazy and technical, I have a short script to fix that.

<!--more-->

* this unordered seed list will be replaced by the toc
{:toc}

Apologies in advace, but `perl` is still my go-to language for quick scripts.

~~~perl
# file: "gm-fixer.pl"
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use feature 'say';

use File::Find::Rule;

my @files;

my $dir         = $ARGV[0] || die "missing argument";
my $mv_files    = $ARGV[1] || 0;

if (! -d $dir) {
    die "$dir: not a directory";
}

my @dirs = File::Find::Rule->directory()->maxdepth(1)->mindepth(1)->in($dir);

foreach my $dir (sort @dirs) {
    #say "[INFO] checking $dir...";
    finder($dir);
}

sub finder {
    my $dir = shift;

    # find paren-copies
    @files = File::Find::Rule->file()
                                ->name( '*([0-9]).mp3' )
                                ->in( $dir );

    foreach my $f2 (sort @files) {
        my $f = $f2;
        $f =~ s{\([1-9]\)}{};
        if ($mv_files) {
            say "[INFO] moving: '$f2' -> '$f'";
            rename($f2, $f) || die "cannot rename: $f2";
        }
        else {
            say "[INFO] found: '$f2'";
        }
    }
}
~~~

Get a feel for the size of the problem:

~~~sh
perl gm-fixer.pl /path/to/root/music/folder
~~~

Rename offending files:
~~~sh
perl gm-fixer.pl /path/to/root/music/folder 1
~~~
