We are pleased to announce the next event from Shake, Battle & Roll! The new name for Stabcon South, the same board games and general geekery weekend you know and love!

Join us for our usual combination of Board Games, Role Playing Games, CCGs, LCGs, Social/Party Games and all other related silliness. The hotel has loads of space and free parking.

Come along, play games and have fun. Bring your favourites games, but don't worry if you don't as there is a huge variety of games in our extensive board games library as well as lots of games for you to join. We're open from 11am on Friday till 11pm on Sunday so that's a whole 60 hours of gaming!
